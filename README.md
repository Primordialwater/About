For the above: if you wish for more information on what 'sensitive subjects' entails, you click on the text, it has been hidden intentionally so as to not force others to be uncomfortable by reading the text.

This also goes for those who tolerate the above sensitive subjects, by that I mean, if you could stop those sensitive subjects, or lessen them, you would still choose not to and allow them to continue. 

> Thin ice.

People who assume the worst of others, especially without knowing the person or how they act.

People treat their assumptions as fact, people who then use that assumption to make a statement about the person.

> About me.

 I like cookie run: kingdom and Genshin Impact.

 I may be blunt at times, or dry. However, I am not devoid of warmth, as I am friendly and I will likely joke around with you.

 If you upset me, I will tell you, only if we're friends or acquaintances.

 I have autism, so let that explain the reason why I may act the way I sometimes do, of course, if I do something wrong, do not use this as a way to justify my actions.

> Some things I find important to note.

One piece of advice for living in this world;

Refrain from assuming the worst of others, gather evidence to support your idea first before treating it as fact. Do not assume that just because you have seen something similar in others before that it means this one has the same intentions as those before it, let it be known that I am not saying to disregard the past occurances. You are allowed to be wary, Infact, it is advised if they are showing similar patterns, just please, don't instantly assume that all humans are the same, for we are not.
